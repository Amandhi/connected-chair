# Lab 1 -  Exercise 1 -  Report

## Controlling LED brightness with a microcontroller
To control the brightness of an LED light with a microcontroller, we decide to use the microcontroller of the Arduino Uno board and reproduced an assembly seen in class. 

Components used :
- Arduino Uno board
- One white LED light
- 220 ohm resistance
- Jumper wires

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch :

We then used the "Brightness" [code](code.ino) from Arduino Examples.
Once the Arduino board was connected to the computer and the above code was uploaded, our white LED turned on.

## Controlling LED brightness without a microcontroller
For this second part, we also reproduced an asssembly seen in class during lab 1. Thus, to control the LED brightness we this time, used a potentiometer
