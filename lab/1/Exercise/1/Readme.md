# Lab 1 -  Exercise 1 -  Report

## Controlling LED brightness with a microcontroller
To control the brightness of an LED light with a microcontroller, we decide to use the microcontroller of the Arduino Uno board and reproduced an assembly seen in class. 

Components used :
- Arduino Uno board
- One white LED light
- 220 ohm resistance
- Jumper wires

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch :

Photos of our assembly :

![](With_Microcontroller2.png?raw=true)



We then used the "Brightness" [code](code.ino) from Arduino Examples.
Once the Arduino board was connected to the computer and the above code was uploaded, our white LED turned on.




## Controlling LED brightness without a microcontroller
For this second part, we also reproduced an asssembly seen in class during lab 1. Thus, to control the LED brightness we this time used a potentiometer.

Components used :
- Arduino Uno board
- Potentiometer
- White LED light
- 220 ohm resistance
- Jumper wires

We connected all these components as indicated in the two following sketches :

![](Without_Microcontroller.png?raw=true)


![](Without_Microcontroller2.png?raw=true)


![](Without_Microcontroller3.png?raw=true)


We then used the [Analog input code](code2.ino).
Once the Arduino Uno board was connected to the PC and the code above was upload, the brightness of the white LED increased or decreased as we turned the button of the potentiometer. Therefore, as expected the light's brightness is this monitored by the potentiometer.
