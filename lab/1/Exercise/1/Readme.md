# Lab 1 -  Exercise 1 -  Report

To control the brightness of an LED light with a microcontroller, we decide to use the microcontroller of the Arduino Uno board and reproduced an assembly seen in class. 

Components used :
- Arduino Uno board
- One white LED light
- 220 ohm resistance
- Jumper wires

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch :

We then used the "Brightness" code from Arduino Examples
