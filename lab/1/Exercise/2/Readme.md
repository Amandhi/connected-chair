# Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Report

## Lesson 15
For this experiment we used this list of components :
- Arduino Uno board
- 4 digit LED segment display
- 220 ohm resistor
- Breadboard 
- Jumper wires

We connected all these components as indicated on the following sketch :

Once we connected the Arduino Uno board to the PC and the [code](code.ino) was uploaded, a counter started on the 4 digit LED segment display. Here is a photo of the result :

## Displaying date on LED screen

For this experiment we used this list of components :
- Arduino Uno board
- 7x 220 ohm resistors
- 7 digit LED segment display
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

We used the same [code2](code2.ino) as previously, but adapted it to our new goal : displaying the date.
We want to display the date 11th November so 1111. However instead of having 1 on the screen, we got a line of "A".
We did not succeed in finding the error and correcting the probleme.
