# Lab 1 - Report

## Lesson 1 : LED Blink

In this first lesson we will produce a basic Arduino assembly to turn on an LED light.

Components used :
- LED
- 220 ohm resistor
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable 

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch and used this [code](LEDBlink.ino)

## Lesson 5 : Fade 

In this lesson we will make an assembly in order to gradually fade the light emitted by the LED.

Components used :
- LED 
- 220 ohm resistor
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch and used this [code](Fade.ino)

## Lesson 10 : RGB LED 

In this lesson we will make an assembly using an RGB LED, to display multiple colour with only one LED.
Components used :
- RGB LED
- 3x 220 ohm resistor
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch and used this [code](RGB_LED.ino).
