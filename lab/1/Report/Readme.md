# Lab 1 - Report

## Lesson 1 : LED Blink

In this first lesson we will produce a basic Arduino assembly to turn on an LED light.

Components used :
- LED
- 220 ohm resistor
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable 

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch and used this [code](LEDBlink.ino).

## Lesson 5 : Fade 

In this lesson we will make an assembly in order to gradually fade the light emitted by the LED.

Components used :
- LED 
- 220 ohm resistor
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch and used this [code](Fade.ino).

## Lesson 10 : RGB LED 

In this lesson we will make an assembly using an RGB LED, to display multiple colour with only one LED.
Components used :
- RGB LED
- 3x 220 ohm resistor
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

We connected all these components as indicated in the following sketch and used this [code](RGB_LED.ino).

## Lesson 10 : Analog Input

In this lesson we will make an assembly to control the LED light brightness with a potentiometer. 

Components used :
- 10 kilo ohm potentiometer
- LED
- 220 ohm resistor
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

We connected the potentiometer as indicated in the following sketch ( for the LED connections, same as lesson 1)  and used this [code](Analog_Input.ino)

Result : As we turn the button of the potentiometer, the brightness of the LED light, increases or decreases.
