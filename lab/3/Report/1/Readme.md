# Lab 3 - Part 1 
## Exprience with BME280 component

We assembled all the components as indicated in the following Fritzing sketches : ![We assembled all components as indicated in this fritzing sketches :](BME280.png?raw=true) 
![](BME280_Sketch.png?raw=true)

We then compiled the [code](code1.ino) bmetest in Arduino, after installing the BME280 library. 
The temperature sensor was then effective. Indeed, temperature values were displayed continously on the Arduino console.
When we covered the sensor with our fingers, these values got higher, therefore the temperature detected by the sensor increased.
