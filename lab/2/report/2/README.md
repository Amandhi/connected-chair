# Lab 2 -  Part 2 -  Report

## Experience with the passive buzzer 
We reproduced the passive buzzer assembly already seen in lab 1.
We followed the instructions of "Lesson 9 : Passive buzzer "

Components used : 
- Passive buzzer
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires 
- USB cable 


Sketches :

Once connecting all these components together and uploading the [code](Buzzer_Code.ino), we observed that when we input a value (on the Arduino console), the frequence of the sound emitted by the buzzer changes.
