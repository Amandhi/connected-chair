# Lab 2 -  Part 2 -  Report

## Experience with the passive buzzer 
We reproduced the passive buzzer assembly already seen in lab 1.
We followed the instructions of "Lesson 9 : Passive buzzer "

Components used : 
- Passive buzzer
- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires 
- USB cable 

Once connecting all these components together and uploading the [code](code.ino) we realised that when we input a value (in the Arduino code), the frequence of the sound emmitted by the buzzer changes.
(We did not succeed in putting photos in this readme.md document, they are however available in the folder).
