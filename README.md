This is the official template for student's projects

Lesson 1 : LEDBLINK
The LED plugged on the Arduino card is recognised thanks to the first line of the code.
The command digitalWrite() in the inifinite loop() enables the LED to blink with a delay, also indicated in the code.

Lesson 6 : Button
The LED as well as the button plugged on the card are recognised thanks to the first two lines of the code.
The button is initialized so that when it is pressed for the first time, the LED turns on and when pressed again, the LED turns off.
The loop() enables the LED to turn on or off when the button is pressed, according to the state of the button ( if()).

Lesson 10 : RGB LED
The three pins LED plugged on the card is recognised thanks to the first three lines.
The loop() enables to display the LED first in red color, then after a delay, the green color is displayed then after another delay, the blue color appears etc.
