Description of the Arduino codes seen during Lab 1

No major difficulties were encountered regarding the Arduino codes. Some difficulties were however encountered while plugging differents elements on to the Arduino Card.

Lesson 1 : LED Blink
The LED plugged in the Arduino card is recognised thanks to the first line in the code.
The digitalWrite() command in the infinite loop enables to LED to blink without interruption with a delay, also indicated in the code.


Lesson 6 : Button 
The LED as well as the button plugged on the card are recognised thanks to the first two lines in the code.
The button is initialised so that when it is pressed for the first time, the LED turns on and when pressed again, the LED turns off.
The loop() enables the LED to turn on or off when the is pressed, according to its state (if() statement)


Lesson 10 : RGB LED 
The three pins LED plugged on the card  is recognised thanks to the first three lines.
The loop() enables to display, first, the red color then after a delay time, the green color is displayed then after another delay, the blue color appears etc.

Lesson 4 : LED Blink 
We connect the led to the pin 13 , then in the loop we define the amount of time we want the led to be on and of with the command  delay() 
So the led keep turning on/off every 1000 milliseconds

Lesson 5 : Fading 
We connect the led to the pin 5 . First  we initialize the initial value of the brightness . In the loop we set brightness and write command so brightness decrease with time and increase again  when it reach the lower point. 
This is why the brightness of the loop keep increasing and decreasing every 30 milliseconds  

Lesson 9 : Passive Buzzer
We connect the buzzer to pin 5 and to GND pin , then in the code, in the loop section , we define the duration and intensity of the sound emitted by the buzzer thanks to the command "tone()". The buzzer then emits a sound continuously.
